        <li>Add the flour mixture and mix on low until almost incorporated, then add the oats and chocolate chips. Mix until combined.</li>

        <li>Roll into cookie dough balls and bake at 375F for 8-10 minutes. It never hurts to add a few chocolate chips on top of the cookie dough balls. This way you’ll have nice spots of chocolate peaking out of each cookie.
